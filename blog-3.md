# Why are Type Guards Necessary? 

TypeScript is a powerful, statically typed superset of JavaScript that introduces type definitions, facilitating the identification of errors during development instead of at runtime. Nevertheless, there are instances when TypeScript's type system can be overly restrictive or unable to correctly infer types due to dynamic behavior. This is where type guards become invaluable.

TypeScript enhances JavaScript with a robust typing system that incorporates type guardsâ€”constructs that enable you to narrow down the type of a variable or expression to a more specific type. This functionality is especially beneficial when dealing with complex data structures, ensuring your code remains type-safe.

Type guards function by applying a set of conditions to determine whether a variable or expression meets specific criteria. If those criteria are fulfilled, the type guard returns a more specific type for that variable or expression. TypeScript offers several types of type guards, including type predicates, `typeof` guards, and `instanceof` guards.

These type guards execute specialized checks to refine the type of a variable within a conditional block. They help ensure correctness and safety when navigating complex data structures and functions, thereby preventing potential bugs arising from incorrect type assumptions. By explicitly defining the conditions under which particular types should be recognized, developers gain enhanced control over their code's behavior while reaping the benefits of TypeScript.

## 1. Type Predicates
Type predicates allow us to define custom functions that return boolean values indicating whether a given value belongs to a particular subtype. Here's how you can refactor our previous example using type predicates:

```typescript
function isBird(animal: Bird | Fish): animal is Bird {
    return typeof (animal as Bird).fly === "function";
}

function move(animal: Bird | Fish) {
    if (isBird(animal)) {
        animal.fly();
    } else {
        (animal as Fish).swim();
    }
}
```

**Use Case**: When dealing with union types consisting of multiple interfaces or classes, consider using type predicates for clearer intent and improved maintainability.

## 2. `instanceof` Operator
The `instanceof` operator checks whether an object has a prototype in its constructor chain. It works well with class hierarchies but fails when dealing with plain objects or interfaces.

```typescript
class Animal {
    move() {}
}

class Dog extends Animal {
    bark() {}
}

function processAnimal(animal: Animal) {
    if (animal instanceof Dog) {
        animal.bark();
    }
}
```

**Use Case**: Ideal for scenarios involving inheritance between classes, especially when combined with polymorphism.

## 3. `in` Keyword
When checking for property existence, use the `in` keyword instead of direct access like `animal.property`. The former won't raise any error even if the property doesn't exist, whereas the latter will throw a runtime exception.

```typescript
interface Shape {
    kind: string;
}

interface Circle extends Shape {
    radius: number;
}

function getArea(shape: Shape) {
    if ("radius" in shape) {
        const circle = shape as Circle;
        return Math.PI * circle.radius ** 2;
    }
    return 0;
}
```

**Use Case**: Suitable when handling optional properties within interfaces or discriminated unions.

## 4. Custom Type Guard Functions
You can create custom type guard functions without relying on built-in keywords like `in`, `instanceof`, or type predicate syntax. These functions simply check certain conditions before returning `true` or `false`.

```typescript
function isNumberEven(num: number): num is even {
    return num % 2 === 0;
}

const myNum = Math.floor(Math.random() * 10);
if (isNumberEven(myNum)) {
    console.log(`${myNum} is even`);
} else {
    console.log(`${myNum} is odd`);
}
```

**Use Case**: Great for simple type checks based on specific criteria, such as verifying numbers or strings meet specific constraints.
